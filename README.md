# marathon-consul [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/marathon-consul.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/marathon-consul)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/allegro/marathon-consul/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/allegro/marathon-consul)


Register [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) Tasks as [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) Services for service discovery.

`marathon-consul` takes information provided by the [Marathon event bus](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/event-bus.html) and
forwards it to Consul agents. It also re-syncs all the information from Marathon 
to Consul on startup and repeats it with given interval.

## Running the program

Just run `marathon-consul`.
You can also add some [options](#options).

The Marathon event bus should point to [`/events`](#endpoints). You can
set up the event subscription with a call similar to this one:

```
curl -X POST 'http://marathon.service.consul:8080/v2/eventSubscriptions?callbackUrl=http://marathon-consul.service.consul:4000/events'
```

## Building from source

To simply compile and run the source code:

```
go run main.go [options]
```

To build the binary:

```
make build
```

To run the tests:

```
make test
```


## Usage

- Consul Agents should be available at every Mesos Slave, tasks will be registered at hosts their run on.
- Only tasks which are labeled as `consul` will be registered in Consul. By default the registered service name is equal to Marathon's application name. 
  A different name can be provided as the label's value, e.g. `consul:customName`. As an exception of the rule, for backward compatibility with the `0.3.x` branch, a value of `true` is resolved to the default name.
- Only services with tag specified by `consul-tag` property will be maintained. This tag is automatically added during registration. **Important**: it should be unique for every Marathon cluster connected to Consul.
- At least one HTTP healthcheck should be defined for a task. The task is registered when Marathon marks it's as alive.
- Provided HTTP healtcheck will be transferred to Consul.
- Labels with `tag` value will be converted to Consul tags, e.g. (note: `consul-tag` is set to `marathon`) `labels: ["public":"tag", "varnish":"tag", "env": "test"]` â†’ `tags: ["public", "varnish", "marathon"]`.
- The scheduled Marathon-consul sync may run in two modes:
    - Only on node that is the current [Marathon-leader](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#get-v2-leader), `sync-leader` parameter should be set to `hostname:port` the current node appears in the Marathon cluster. 
      This mode is **enabled by default** and the `sync-leader` property is set to the hostname resolved by OS.
      Note that there is a difference between `sync-leader` and `marathon-location`: `sync-leader` is used for node leadership detection (should be set to cluster-wide node name), while `marathon-location` is used for connection purpose (may be set to `localhost`)
    - On every node, `sync-force` parameter should be set to `true`

### Known limitations

The following section describes known limitations with `marathon-consul`.

* Every marathon application needs to have a unique service name in Consul.
* In Marathon when a deployment changing the application's service name (by changing its `labels`) is being stopped, it changes app's configuration anyway.
  This means we loose the link between the app and the services registered with the old name in Consul. 
  Later on, if another deployment takes place, new services are registered with a new name, the old ones are not being deregistered though.
  A scheduled sync is required to wipe them out.
